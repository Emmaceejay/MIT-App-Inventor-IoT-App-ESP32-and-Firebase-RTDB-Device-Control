# MIT-App-Inventor-IoT-App-ESP32-and-Firebase-RTDB-Device-Control
MIT App Inventor IoT App | ESP32 and Firebase RTDB Device Control

This is a project that shows the use of MIT App Inventor for IoT app front-end and Firebase as a back-end to build an IOT App, the microcontroller used here is an ESP8266-based microcontroller "Wemos D1" the Arduino form factor type, the same code will work for any ES8266 with minimal variation on the GPIO, and also this code can be use for ESP32 as well, with a little change on wifi connection library.

Libraries to install for this.
* Arduino Client Library for ESP8266 and ESP32 4.4.14

Note: The code in this project was copied from the "Enjoy Mechatronics" GitHub repo.
I combined two of the different code samples and combined them, then made some modifications to them to create this project
1. For sensor upload to Firebase from ESP32:  https://github.com/Enjoy-Mechatronics
2. For controlling devices from Firebase: https://github.com/Enjoy-Mechatronics.
